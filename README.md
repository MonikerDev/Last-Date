# __LAST DATE__

_Last Date_ is a survival-horror, role-playing game with a dating-simulation set up. The game follows the exploits of seven girls and their desperate attempts to survive the spreading horrors within their town. Delve into the darkest corners of Coolbrook and discover the truths that lie within. Those who seek answers may not like all that they find, however, as sometimes the truth is best left buried. Coolbrook does not see many visitors outside of students, so most of its businesses and people have been there as long as they can remember. It is never too late to prepare for the worst. Whether or not the decision is to face that which lurks beneath the surface, one must stay prepared in this world. Gather supplies, plans, and allies to face the truth. Even then, time is precious.
